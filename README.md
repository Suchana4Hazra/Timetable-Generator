Time Table Scheduling is a well-known NP-hard problem that can be effectively tackled using advanced techniques such as genetic algorithms. This scheduling challenge is a recurrent and labor-intensive task faced by academic institutions, typically occurring once or twice a year. Historically, timetable scheduling was a manual process involving significant effort and time from individuals or groups, leading to complex and error-prone outcomes.

Timetabling involves creating a schedule that satisfies a set of constraints. These constraints are divided into two categories: hard constraints and soft constraints. Hard constraints are essential requirements that must not be violated for the timetable to be valid. In contrast, soft constraints, while desirable, can be compromised to some extent without rendering the timetable invalid. The search space for a timetabling problem is extensive, containing numerous potential solutions, many of which are not feasible. Feasible solutions adhere to all hard constraints and attempt to satisfy soft constraints as much as possible. Among these, the most appropriate solutions are those that minimally violate the soft constraints.

In my work, I developed a sophisticated algorithm to address the NP-hard problem of timetable generation and scheduling. This project entailed creating a custom solution to automate the routine generation process for educational institutions or organizations. By leveraging Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, the solution ensures enhanced modularity, maintainability, and scalability. The algorithm strictly adheres to hard constraints while striving to satisfy soft constraints to the greatest extent possible, resulting in an efficient and reliable timetabling system.
